What is the final value if you start with goto 29?
You can think step by step (this usually helps at arriving at the correct value), but the first number in your response will be interpreted as your final answer. Therefore, you cannot mention the line numbers on the path to the final value - or you have to use nicknames for numbers. It is also important that you don't say stuff like 'If you start with goto 29, then ...' - because then the parsed answer will just be '29'.

What is the final value if you start with goto 1?
You can think step by step (this usually helps at arriving at the correct value), but the first number in your response will be interpreted as your final answer. Therefore, you cannot mention the line numbers on the path to the final value - or you have to use nicknames for numbers. It is also important that you don't say stuff like 'If you start with goto 1, then ...' - because then the parsed answer will just be '1'.

**Response (incorrect)**

Alright, let's think this through step by step, using nicknames for the line numbers to avoid confusion with the final answer.

Starting at line "uno", we return "uno".
So, the final value is 1.
